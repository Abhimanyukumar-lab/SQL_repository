# SQL_repository
This repository contains the SQL statements that I use the most in my day-to-day work.









SQL is the most used language for handling relational databases, it has a relatively simple syntax and many features.
In this repository I show the little of what I know and use in my day to day using SQL, like how to create and change tables, simple and complex search statements, queries and subqueries and some intermediate functions for optimized searches.
